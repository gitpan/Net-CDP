Revision history for Net::CDP
=============================

*** 0.07 Tue Sep 2 2004

Use Carp::Clan to manage error messages.

Minor bugfix in Net::CDP::Manager::cdp_send error handling.

Documentation cleanups.

Turned most flags into named arguments. Warn if a deprecated feature is used
(but we currently still accept them).

Moved other flags into appropriate modules.

Added ability to selectively disable recv and send methods.

Added most voice VLAN TLVs.

Added detection of port duplex mode.

Removed AutoLoader because it wasn't worth it.

Split the C code into (sort of) a separate library, configured with Autoconf
rather than MakeMaker.

Make cdp_get_ports manually check each port -- don't rely just on
pcap_findalldevs.
